# The ROS-chessbot

This package implements a robotic assistant for motion-impaired chess player. To date, the robot cannot play autonomously. The main goal of the application is the robust execution of the moves requested by the player via an accessible interface (joystick, touchpad, mouse, vocal command) using the standard chess equipment used in official competitions.

# How to use

## TIAGo robot

See the [instructions](docs/TIAGo_instructions.md) to run the application on the PAL Robotics TIAGo robot.
